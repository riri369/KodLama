                    <h3>Youth Preparedness</h3>

                    <ul>
                        Emergencies and disasters can happen at any time, often without warning. Disaster planning,
                        response, and recovery efforts must take into account the unique needs of children, who make up
                        roughly a quarter of the U.S. population.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Starting or getting involved with a youth preparedness program is a great way to enhance a
                            community’s resilience and help develop future generations of prepared adults. The Federal
                            Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) offers numerous resources that can help.</li>

                    <h3>FEMA's Youth Preparedness Council</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>FEMA created the Youth Preparedness Council (YPC) in 2012 to bring together young leaders
                            who are interested in supporting disaster preparedness and making a difference in their
                            communities, by completing disaster preparedness projects nationally and locally. The YPC
                            supports FEMA’s commitment to involve America’s youth in preparedness-related activities. It
                            also provides an avenue to engage young people by taking into account their perspectives,
                            feedback, and opinions. YPC members meet with FEMA staff throughout their term to provide
                            input on strategies, initiatives, and projects. YPC members also attend the annual YPC
                            Summit in Washington, DC, meet periodically with FEMA representatives, and work to complete
                            a number of emergency preparedness projects. The YPC members are selected based on their
                            dedication to public service, their efforts in making a difference in their communities, and
                            their potential to expand their impact as national supporters of youth preparedness.

                    <h3>National Strategy for Youth Preparedness Education</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed by FEMA, the U.S. Department of Education, and the American Red Cross, the
                            National Strategy for Youth Preparedness Education presents nine steps partners can take to
                            help build a Nation of prepared youth. The steps focus on building partnerships to enhance
                            youth preparedness learning programs; connecting young people with their families,
                            communities, first responders, and other youth; and increasing preparedness at school.
                            9 Priority Steps for Creating a Nation of Prepared Youth</li>

                        <li>Elevate the importance of youth preparedness learning programs at the national, state, and
                            local levels.</li>
                        <li>Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of existing and new youth preparedness programs.</li>
                        <li>Support the implementation of youth preparedness learning programs.</li>
                        <li>Create positive relationships between youth and the first responder community.</li>
                        <li>Link youth preparedness to family and community participation, especially in communities
                            where English may not be the first language spoken (or understood) among adults, in other
                            underrepresented communities, and inclusive of individuals with access and functional needs.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make school preparedness a key component of youth preparedness.</li>
                        <li>Build and strengthen productive partnerships among stakeholder agencies and organizations.
                        </li>
                        <li>Identify opportunities to embed youth preparedness in youth culture.</li>
                        <li>Design a sustaining, locally driven model for developing, designing, and delivering
                            programming.</li>
                    </ul>

                        Below is a brief overview of the seven steps to implementing a successful youth preparedness
                        program.
                        <h3>Step 1: Getting Started</h3>

                        To ensure a successful youth preparedness program, a program leader must begin by assessing the
                        needs of the community, identifying the goals of the program, and securing the necessary
                        financing and resources to facilitate a smooth launch. The first step involves deciding what to
                        include in the program. For example, will it include information and training on a particular
                        type of disaster, or general information about family preparedness and/or emergency response?
                        Once you have identified your community’s needs, you will be able to establish a focus for your
                        youth program.
                        <h3>Step 2: Engaging Partners</h3>

                        Youth preparedness requires collaboration. The second step in implementing a youth preparedness
                        program is to identify and secure partners, and to define the roles and responsibilities for
                        each partner. To get started, refer to the Partnership Checklist in the Implementation Guide.
                        <h3>Step 3: Identifying Your Curriculum</h3>

                        A variety of youth preparedness programs exist already, each one designed to meet the needs of
                        different communities and the different age groups of youth participants. The third step
                        involves determining who your audience is, choosing what topics to focus on, and identifying a
                        curriculum that meets the demands of those audiences and topics. The FEMA Youth Preparedness
                        Catalog: Disaster Preparedness Education Programs and Resources lists a number of curricula that
                        may work for you. Email fema-youth-preparedness@fema.dhs.gov to request printed copies of
                        Student Tools for Emergency Planning (STEP).
                        <h3>Step 4: Implementing Your Program</h3>

                        Once your curriculum is in place and your instructors and other staff have been trained, it’s
                        time to put your program into action. The fourth step includes determining scheduling,
                        locations, staffing, and other logistics as you launch your program. The FEMA Youth Preparedness
                        Program Implementation Workbook includes various activities to help you think through the
                        effectiveness of your implementation process.
                        <h3>Step 5: Promoting Your Program</h3>

                        Once your program is implemented, raising program awareness within your community is an
                        important next step. This involves mapping out your promotional plan, securing the appropriate
                        budget and staffing for each promotional effort, and executing these initiatives.
                        <h3>Step 6: Evaluating Your Program</h3>

                        Evaluating your program helps to drive program improvements and, ultimately, leads to greater
                        success. There are many evaluative methods you can and should employ. The sixth step involves
                        creating your evaluation plan and managing logistical concerns as you conduct your evaluation.
                        <h3>Step 7: Sustaining Your Program</h3>
                    </ul>
                    As program leader you should create a formal sustainability plan that lays out clear goals and
                    objectives to ensure the long-term success of your program. The final step involves developing this
                    plan. Planning includes steps for working with community partners to generate greater program
                    exposure, establishing a working group, exploring various funding sources, and updating your
                    curriculum.
